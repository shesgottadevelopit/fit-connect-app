Questions

1. To only display "Logout" when a user is logged in, how would I get the data to apply that to the templating logic. Same applies for only showing "Sign up" and "Login" if the user is not logged in.
2. How can I add the user's name to the path to the dashboard if they navigate to the home page. I think I need to pass in an object within the route for the homepage, but I'm not sure what process I'd need to run to get that data (an if/else statement possibly)

2.
