## Fit Connect App

### Project Description
The original concept was limited to women, but **Fit Connect** is an application that helps **all** individuals connect with others based on their similar fitness goals. This will help anyone who wants an accountability partner or someone who gets more motivated (and accountable) when working with others than just alone.


### Project UI
Users will be able to create a personal account, set up their profile to include basic info (age, sex, location) and fitness details: their current fitness level, their preferred gym or workout locations, classes or fitness programs they enjoy or would like to participate in, along with days/times for workout scheduling.

Users will then be able to browse the database and connect with others with similar profiles. They can save profiles for later.
